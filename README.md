- âš¡ Fun fact: I believe that by learning more than one language, a programmer develop a deeper understanding of programming concepts and logic, as each language approaches problems in its own unique way. Having knowledge of multiple programming languages enables a programmer to be more versatile, efficient, and effective in their work.
